Open-Sora : Democratizing Efficient Video Production for All 

## Introduction

This repository provides code for *On-device Sora*, which is an open-sourced implementation of paper named *On-device Sora: Enabling Diffusion-Based Text-to-Video Generation for Mobile Devices*. 


### On-Device Sora
*On-device Sora* applies Linear Proportional Leap (LPL), Temporal Dimension Token Merging (TDTM), and Concurrent Inference with Dynamic Loading (CI-DL) to enable efficient video generation on the iPhone 15 Pro.

### Open-Sora

[Open-Sora](https://github.com/hpcaitech/Open-Sora) is a baseline model of On-Device Sora, an open-source project for video generation, and a T2V Diffusion model that can produce videos based on text input.

## How to convert each model to MLPackage for On-device Sora

## Package Dependencies

### Dependency 
```
cd Device_conversion

conda create -n convert python=3.10

conda activate convert

pip install -r requirements/requirements-convert.txt

pip install -v .
```

## Converting

### T5 Converting
```
cd t5
python3 export-t5.py
```

### STDiT Convering
```
cd stdit3
python3 export-stdit3.py
```

### VAE Converting
When you run `export-vae-spatial.py`, There are some error that is `Fatal Python error: PyEval_SaveThread`.
To address this error, you should only run one code block for each VAE part. Comment out the rest.

```
cd vae

# for vae's temporal part
python3 export-vae-temporal.py

# for vae's spatial part
python3 export-vae-spatial.py
```

## How to Use

### Required
* Mac device for xcode
* Apple Account to build and launch the app
* iPhonne: over iPhone 15 pro
* iOS version: over 18
* All MLPackage (T5, STDiT, VAE)

### Download converted MLPackage (if you don't want to convert each model to MLPackage)

You can download and use the converted models from the following link. [[Download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L6pVi3KmyLygR_pvKofRL-21adKsEb4p?usp=sharing)]

### Run the app
* Implement xcode project by clicking On-device/On-device-Sora.xcodeproj
* Change the Team (None -> Your Apple account) in TARGETS/Signing&Capabilities
* Launch the app
